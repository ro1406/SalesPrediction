# Time Series Analysis â€“ Sales Forecasting Workshop

Dataset adapted from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sureshmecad/supplement-sales-prediction

---------------
### Template_Notebook_For_Workshop.ipynb
Used as a starting point for the code-with-me workshop

### Dataset_Diagnostics.ipynb
Code and brief explanations of the diagnostics plots used

### Post workshop exploration:
1) Use DARTS with different models instead of LGBM Regressor
2) Are there other features we can derive from the given features?
3) Do we need so many extra features (Discount, Holiday, DayOfWeek, etc)? 
4) Use different lags in DARTS (based on AC and PAC plots)
